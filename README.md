# documentation

We started with phenotype and genotype data files from TERRA-REF. These files were accessed directly from TERRA-REF using code found here for the trait data and here for the geneotype data.

The phenotype data was transformed into this [file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wxPZUNe6-2DxEYNpklahUOScweRmuiV9Vc0ax6JWFLY/edit#gid=1382556769) for use in the ML model and this file for GWAS. 

The genotype data is in VCF and HapMap files.
